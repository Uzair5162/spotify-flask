# spotify-flask

Here you'll find a very straightforward way to request data from Spotify API using flask with templates.  

I'm creating this repository because I have not found a full (or almost full) implementation of a Flask app using Spotify API, altough
https://github.com/datademofun/spotify-flask and https://github.com/drshrey/spotify-flask-auth-example have some nice work, and I'm
grateful for these repositories :smile:!

## How can I run it?

    1. Follow [this tutorial](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/tutorial/) to create your own Spotify App.  
       Add "http://127.0.0.1:8080/callback/" as a redirect URI  

    2. Create a conf.json file with the exact same sctructure of the conf_example.json file  
    
    3. run install.sh to install dependencies  
    
    4. python app.py
